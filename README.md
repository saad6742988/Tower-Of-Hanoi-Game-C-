# Tower Of Hanoi Game in C++
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, with the smallest disk at the top. The objective is to move the entire stack to another rod, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it onto another stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Despite its simple rules, the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is known for its mathematical properties and has intrigued mathematicians and computer scientists for centuries. It's often used as an introductory example in programming and algorithm courses to teach concepts like recursion and problem-solving strategies. Additionally, it serves as a fun and engaging brain teaser for enthusiasts of all ages.

# Code Description
### This Game is Built Using Stack

This code starts with asking number of disks you want in game then it will display three poles with selected number of disks. Then, it will ask you number of pole from which you want to pop and push the disk.
In the end, when all the disks have been moved to last pole, it shows total number of moves.
